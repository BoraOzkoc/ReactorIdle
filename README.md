# ReactorIdle

In this game you need to collect resources to put in the reactor in order to produce fuel for the city.
After putting the resources into the reactor you need to start the engine with a mini game(timing).
When energy is produced in the reactor you can attach the city to the reactor with a rope(Obi rope) and city starts generating money.
With that money you can unlock new cities.
There is a mine cart that automaticly collects resources for you and brings it back to reactor.
Ä°f you wanted to complete the first circle you need to open all cities in it. After that 
4 new transformers appear and you need to connect them to the reactor to complete the first level
The game is endless so if you finish all 3 circle (village -> city -> metropolis) you can keep all electric running for all levels.
